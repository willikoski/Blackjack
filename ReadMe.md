Create a for loop for amount of decks,

Create A Main Class, and set objects of what card face has what value
-if statement for if more then 21 value an ACE card is valued at 1


A Bust function if lost (over 21)

A monetary value
-Lose what you bet
-Gain on Win
-Blackjacks=INSTANT win 1.5x 


After win it actually takes from the deck count, 52 cards took 5 before= 47



if the deck is at ITS half value, it will reshuffle with the full amount



Make it so every hit the player takes the House will reply, or show its card.
-House has a rule it must hit below 17-BUT it will ALSO hit if theirs an ACE













Add at least one sound effect (On win Maybe)
